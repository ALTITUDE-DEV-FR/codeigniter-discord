# codeigniter-discord or Standalone

This simple code, originally designed for my Codeigniter 4 project, allows sending Discord notifications in PHP using CURL and JSON. It enables you to send notifications in simple, markdown, or enriched formats with various options, including text-to-speech!

It's easily adaptable to your projects and can be used in various scenarios such as:

CRON job actions in your app, providing direct feedback on Discord.
Notifying about issues on your website.
Receiving orders (Woocommerce, Codeigniter, Laravel, etc.).
Notifying about new sign-ups.
The possibilities are endless, and it offers the advantages of being free, utilizing the power of Discord, and providing push notifications on mobile!

It's currently implemented on https://andromede-cms.com/fr and https://altitude-dev.com/fr, for example, in the case of client contact forms.
